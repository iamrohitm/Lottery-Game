# 🎲 Lottery Game Web App  

A simple and engaging **Lottery Game Web App** built with **React.js**. This app generates dynamic lottery tickets and determines winners using a customizable function. Easily tweak the logic to set your own winning conditions!

---

## 🌟 Features  

- **Dynamic Lottery Tickets:** Generates tickets with random numbers.  
- **Customizable Winning Logic:** Update the function to define new winning conditions.  
- **React.js Powered:** Built with React's modular and functional components.  
- **Simple Winning Rule:** Tickets with all identical numbers are winning tickets.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. **Ticket Generation:** The `Lottery` component generates a ticket with random numbers.  
2. **Winning Evaluation:** A custom function (`winCondition`) checks if the ticket meets the winning criteria.  
3. **Declare Winner:** If all numbers on a ticket are identical, it's a winner!

## 🛠️ Customizing the Winning Condition  

The winning condition is defined as a function in the `App.js` file:  

```javascript  
const winCondition = (ticket) => ticket.every((num) => num === ticket[0]);  
```  

To change the logic, simply update the `winCondition` function to suit your requirements.
